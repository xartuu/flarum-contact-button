Adds a contact button, which opens an email with the administrator's addressee.
## How does it work?
Adds a configurable button with the name you want. After clicking on it, it redirects to the email address or website indicated by you.
⠀
## The main goal was,
to quickly contact the board administrator. In case of problems, errors or bugs, the administration has to react quickly, so this is how Contact Button is created.
⠀

## About me
As you can probably already see from the code, I am a new person in the Java Script environment. I've been working in PHP for two months now and, as it will be written in the description on my forum, the planned start - less than a second after midnight in the new year! - my decision for the New Year will be to learn js for future projects. I noticed that sometimes it is more useful than any other language. That's why I decided to do so. I won't develop more, because I'll write more about myself than about my extension. I'm glad that you're reading it to the end, and you didn't come in to see what it's like and left :)
